### I floated in a sensory deprivation tank.

I felt very alone, but I was ok with that.

Time passed so quickly and before I knew it, it was over. 

Physically there was a feeling of peace. Thoughts that bothered me before entering quickly dispersed and had no impact.

My emotional state was neutral. No pangs of anxiety, no push or pull of action. Thoughts that brought me to tears had no effect at this time.

There was no epiphany. There was no hallucination. Just peace. A gift of nothing to myself.

### But the aftermath was the hardest.

Waking the next morning with heart pounding anxiety. As if I had cleansed my mind but the fears, worries, desires flooded back into me all at once. 

There was an urge for validation, "I did this cool thing, look at me. Please look at me." An urge to escape that above feeling of unease through attention.

It seems the experience of the float was not what mattered. The nothingness was a temporary stillness, a retreat.

What matters is I've learned what happens to me after this stillness. That my task is to learn to handle the reality that inevitably returns.

Every part of me wants to go back in there because it felt safe. But safety is not the goal here.
